  summary: Originally began as a Pre-Pharmacy Major. Officially switched to Computer Science in my Junior year after
  suffering a crisis of faith during the Fall 2016 semester, along with struggling to keep up with my Organic Chemistry class.
  I originally intended to switch to a math major, I found computer science more interesting and decided to switch to that instead.
